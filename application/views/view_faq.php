                                            The maximum loan amount we currently offer is HK$300,000 with interest rates determined based on your credit score. The effective 
                                            interest rate is calculated based on the loan amount excluding the portion of interest recognized as a “handling fee” according to 
                                            general market practice. Therefore, the effective interest rate of the loan reflects all future interest payments and the actual costs. 
                                            This is the common practice in the banking and money lending industries. Depending on your repayment ability, we offer loan tenors 
                                            from 2 weeks to 48 months.

                                            The interest rate we charge the borrowers is in the range of 1.5-2.5% per month. The return you can make on your capital at risk is 
                                            80% of that interest (20% we collect as our commission) which yields net APR of 15-25%. However, the return is not guaranteed since 
                                            your capital is at risk - there is a risk of 100% loss of capital and interest on a facility should a borrower default and debt 
                                            recovery and legal proceedings are not successful.
